# CalculatorCLI-GUI

A simple Python calculator with both CLI and GUI modes, supporting basic arithmetic operations and history tracking using SQLite.

Features:

Perform basic arithmetic calculations (+, -, *, /),in CLI mode can be performed single operation at a time
but in GUI mode longer numerical exressions,containing parenthesis.
CLI mode for terminal-based interaction
Storing previous calculations in file for one case and in SQLite database for another
GUI mode using Tkinter
Very basic but Responsive GUI with dynamically adjusting font sizes

Installing & Usage

Ensure you have python installed
clone the repository
Run program for CLI mode "CalculatorCLI.py" file and for GUI mode "CalculatorGUI.py" file

Technologies Used

Python (Core logic)
Tkinter (GUI interface)
SQLite (Database for history tracking)

Future Improvements

Enhance the CLI version to support solving more complex expressions, beyond those containing just a single operator.
In the GUI version add more operations to complete the math calculator.
Implement support for scientific calculations.
Enhance the GUI with a more appealing design.
Add extensive checks to prevent invalid expressions (see the description of the add_in_entry(text) function in the CalculatorGUI.py file for more details)
